# passerine_flash_signals
Data from: Phylogenetic analyses support flush-pursuit foraging and flocking behaviors as evolutionary drivers of flash plumage signals in North American passerines

Description of the data and file structure

Included are scripts to run the analyses in the manuscript "Phylogenetic analyses support flush-pursuit foraging and flocking behaviors as evolutionary drivers of flash plumage signals in North American passerines". The data include plumage scoring for the presence or absence of a variety of contrasting plumage patches, a set of variables used to predict them, and a phylogenetic tree of North American passerine birds based on Burleigh et al. 2015. Analyses can be run by first running the script "flash_signal_analyses_Diet.3Cat.R", which draws from .csv files associated with this Dryad entry, and then running the script "flash_best_models_SI_revision2.R".

Code/software

The scripts are R scripts, which were run successfully in R 4.4.0 before uploading. Running the scripts requires the following packages: phylolm, geiger, MuMIn, rlist, dplyr, rr2.
